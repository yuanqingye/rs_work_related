Incentive:to do more, to earn more,specialist driven
Structure: 
1Physician oriented, doctor has info and then the power: they can rec expansive but not useful service
2The healthcare services system is isolated and discontinous, very bad for chronical disease(one of the cause is specialized healthcare)
3Special doctor dominated
4Want to transform to patient oriented, which can be good experience to both doctor and patients(By means of care coordination and the communication;Higher quality,Lower cost)

Quality care
Patient centered
HIT
Practice Organization

I could see the problem:
chronical disease dominate the people beyond 45 years old
99% has at least one disease
96% has multi-disease
20% has 5 or more and these people cost 50%

medical error cause 200000 accident
in which 50000 could lead to death

learning health System(a positive feed back system)
adopt data-> data integration -> analysis then pass to provider for practice-> step1 again
