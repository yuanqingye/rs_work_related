You can now create and use multiple cursors within RStudio. Multiple cursors can be created in a variety of ways:

Press Ctrl + Alt + {Up/Down} to create a new cursor in the pressed direction,

Press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + {Direction} to move a second cursor in the specified direction,

Use Alt and drag with the mouse to create a rectangular selection,

Use Alt + Shift and click to create a rectangular selection from the current cursor position to the clicked position.

RStudio also makes use of multiple cursors in its Find / Replace toolbar now. After entering a search term, if you press the All button, all items matching that search term are selected.

You can use CTRL + . to quickly navigate between files and symbols within a project. Previously, this search utility performed prefix matching, and so it was difficult to use with long file / symbol names. Now, the CTRL + . navigator uses fuzzy matching to narrow the candidate set down based on subsequence matching, which makes it easier to navigate when many files share a common prefix—for example, to test- files for a project managing its tests with testthat.

You can use Ctrl + Shift + E to select everything within the nearest pair of opening and closing brackets, or use Ctrl + Alt + Shift + E to expand the selection up to the next closing bracket.

You just want to call an external application: wouldn't the following work?

RStudio doesn't have a "disabled" state for breakpoints. You can clear (remove) all the breakpoints via Debug -> Clear All Breakpoints. 
 ## R
 Sys.getenv("R_USER")
 # [1] "C:\\Users\\Josh"
 Sys.setenv(R_USER="C://")
 path.expand("~")
 # [1] "C://"
 
 To set the starting value of "R_USER" for all of your R/Rstudio sessions, just add a line like the following to your ~/.Renviron or $R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site or wherever you prefer.
