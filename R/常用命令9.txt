If you also want to install rggobi, you can install everything from within R, with the following command:  source("http://www.ggobi.org/downloads/install.r")

For RMSE missing, normally, that is a model fit problem(either resample or other step has some problems)
If you type warnings() you'll see that in both cases the model fit failed for every resample.
You can try fitting a single model to your data with the getModelInfo('treebag')[['treebag']]$fit and getModelInfo('treebag')[['treebag']]$predict to help you figure out what's wrong with the model or your data.

#使用进度条

for(i in u) {  
   info<- sprintf("已完成 %d%%", round(i*100/length(u)))  
   setTkProgressBar(pb, i*100/length(u), sprintf("进度 (%s)", info),info)  
}     
close(pb)

#使用进度条2

Goes into BIC, We see the diff between varies num of components

In R the BIC formula is given by:
2 * loglik - nparams * log(n)
which is reverse sign of original standard formula
so the higer the better

specified order 
factor(data$orderedfield,levels = data$orderedfield)

qy_inter_umid = Reduce(intersect,list(qy_1106_umid,qy_1109_umid,qy_1110_umid,qy_1112_umid,qy_1113_umid))

#Using reduce to make the transform from binary to decimal
There is a one-liner solution:
Reduce(function(x,y) x*2+y, a)
Explanation:
Expanding the application of Reduce results in something like:
Reduce(function(x,y) x*2+y, c(0,1,0,1,0)) = (((0*2 + 1)*2 + 0)*2 + 1)*2 + 0 = 10

#二进制字符串转化成具体数字
library(compositions)
a <- c(0,0,0,1,0,1)
achar <- paste(a,collapse="")
unbinary(achar)
