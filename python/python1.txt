总纲领：
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello World!')

r = numpy.random.rand(2, 10, 10) 
Now we want to reshape to 5 X 5 x 8:
numpy.reshape(r, shape=(5, 5, 8)) 
will do the job.
Note that, once you fix first dim = 5 and second dim = 5, you don't need to determine third dimension. To assist your laziness, python gives the option of -1:
numpy.reshape(r, shape=(5, 5, -1))

How to define a code cell¶
A “code cell” is a concept similar to MATLAB’s “cell” (except that there is no “cell mode” in Spyder), i.e. a block of lines to be executed at once in the current interpreter (Python or IPython). Every script may be divided in as many cells as needed.
Cells are separated by lines starting with:
#%% (standard cell separator)
# %% (standard cell separator, when file has been edited with Eclipse)
# <codecell> (IPython notebook cell separator)

You can also use this:
# In[1]
