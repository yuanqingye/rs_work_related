Keras is a tool we recommend for rapid prototyping. It allows you to quickly try out different model architectures. Are there any applications of deep learning to your daily life that you'd like to implement using Keras?
Remember how to code a model in Keras and the four steps leading to the evaluation of your model on the test set. Create->Compile->Fit/Train->Evaluate/Test.
